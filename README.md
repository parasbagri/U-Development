# React Project

## Project Overview

This is my React project, created as part of my React course. The project demonstrates various React concepts, including component creation, state management, hooks, and more. The purpose of this project is to practice and apply the skills learned during the course.

## Current Features

- **Component-based architecture:** Created multiple reusable components.
- **State management:** Managed state using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- **React Router:** Implemented navigation between different components.
- **API Integration:** Fetched data from APIs and displayed it in the components.

## What's Next?
